General Purpose Photo Gallery (GPPG, pronounced Jeep-Pig)
=========================================================

GPPG is a static HTML photo gallery generator that is meant to be easy to keep operational over several years.
I'd like to have some sort of a photo collection to show for my kids when they grow up.
My design goal for GPPG is to have a photo gallery generator that I can maintain at least for the next twenty years.

Sadly it seems I must macgyver it out of simple tools myself.
Recent experiences with online services have proven that they do not provide sufficient longevity.
Even when I am willing to pay, the service may be cancelled or image access is restricted.
GPPG should only need storage, shell access and a web server.
I do not anticipate them going out of favor soon.

DTP?
====

Yes, this used to be named after duct tape.
However, the Jeep car is closer to the mindset of this project.
Simple construction, easy to repair.
MacGyver drove a Jeep.

Also, pigs are cool.
