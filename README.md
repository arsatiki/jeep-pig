duct-tape-photos
================

DTP is a static HTML photo gallery generator that is seemingly held together only by duck tape.

Appearances are deceiving.
My design goal for DTP is to have a photo gallery generator that I can maintain at least for the next twenty years.
I'd like to have some sort of a photo collection to show for my kids when they grow up.
Sadly it seems I must mcgyver it out of simple tools myself.

Recent experiences with online services have proven that they do not provide sufficient longevity.
Even when I am willing to pay, the service may be cancelled or image access is restricted.
DTP should only need storage and a web server.
I do not anticipate them going out of favor soon.
